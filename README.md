# YouTubeCrawler
To construct a network of children videos we crawl data from a single video of an input query. Data will be acquired from a parent video and its recommended videos that usually range from 100 to 120 in number. So, for instance, if crawling starts from one video, all its data will first be scrapped and then the video IDs of its 100 120 recommended videos will be put into a queue so that the crawler moves onto each of them in order. By repeating this process for every video, we could record the parent-child relationships between different videos. Every time a video undergoes a crawling process, its counter will be updated so that the video is not crawled no more than 10 times in repetition. The reason for this is that a parent video and a child video could keep recommending each other back and forth in a loop. Although this would indicate that these pair of videos are dominant in the network, we set a threshold to the loop to reduce the unnecessary computing power. The data acquired for each video will be as the following: video ID, title, description, tags, channel title, published time, duration, comment count, dislike count, like count, view count, for-Kids Boolean, recommended videos, parent video, counter.
